<h1 class="ui header">Custom Login Page with Sign In Widget</h1>
<div *ngIf="!isAuthenticated">
  <p>If youâ€˜re viewing this page then you have successfully started this Angular application.</p>
  <p>This example shows you how to use the
    <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-js/tree/master/packages/okta-angular">Okta Angular Library</a>
    and the
    <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget">Okta Sign-In Widget</a>
    to add the
    <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-auth-code-pkce">PKCE Flow</a>
    to your application.
    This combination is useful when you want to leverage the features of the Sign-In Widget, and the authentication helper components from the okta-angular module.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you have logged in you will be redirected through your authorization server (the issuer defined in config) to create a session for Single-Sign-On (SSO).
    After this you will be redirected back to the application with an ID Token and Access Token. The tokens will be stored in local storage for future use.
  </p>
  <button id="login-button" class="ui primary button" role="button" routerLink="/login">Login</button>
</div>

<div *ngIf="isAuthenticated && userName">
  <p>Welcome back, {{ userName }}!</p>
  <p>
    You have successfully authenticated against your Okta org, and have been redirected back to this application.  You now have an ID Token and access token in local storage.
    Visit the <a href="/profile">My Profile</a> page to take a look inside the ID Token.
